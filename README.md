# Riemann Hypothesis Pattern Evolution System

## Overview

This project presents a novel approach to investigating the Riemann Hypothesis through pattern evolution and binary relationships. By analyzing resonance patterns between prime numbers and zeta zeros as coupled systems, we demonstrate remarkable correlations that support the hypothesis while revealing deep connections to natural resonance phenomena and quantum mechanical systems.

- Stability through mutual resonance
- Quantum entanglement analogies

### 2. Prime Relationships
- Gap-based stability calculations
- Harmonic evolution through prime ratios
- Frequency convergence toward zeta zeros
- Critical line emergence at Re(s) = 1/2

### 3. Mathematical Framework
- Pattern space definition with binary coupling

- Convergence proofs with paired stability
- Information-energy balance principles
- Quantum mechanical correspondence

## Theoretical Framework

### Pattern Evolution
```
H(p) = T(p) + V(p) + B(p)
where:
T(p) = ∑ᵢ w(i)h_i²/2          (kinetic term)
V(p) = k|f - f_target|²/2      (potential term)
B(p) = ∑ᵢ β(p,pᵢ)ω(p,pᵢ)      (binary coupling term)
```

### Binary Coupling
```
β(p₁, p₂) = exp(-|f₁/f₂ - r|)    (coupling strength)
ω(p₁, p₂) = |f₁/f₂ - r|/r        (resonance deviation)
```

### Resonance Function
```
R(p) = αS_p(p) + βS_h(p) + γS_φ(p) + δS_f(p) + εS_b(p)
```

### Quantum Operations
```typescript
// Hadamard gate with sqrt(0.5) amplitude
H|ψ⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩ + |1⟩)

// Tunneling with momentum-based distance
T(p₁,p₂) = exp(-α|d|²)

// Entanglement with coherence decay
E(p₁,p₂) = β(p₁,p₂)e^{-γt}
```
